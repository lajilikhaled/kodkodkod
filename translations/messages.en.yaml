equipe-project.smart-contracts.description.part1.subtitle: "Smart Contracts on Blockchain: definition and operation"
equipe-project.smart-contracts.description.part1.desc1: "A Smart Contract is a self-executing computer program stored on a blockchain, designed to facilitate, verify or automatically execute agreements or contracts between parties, without requiring the intervention of a trusted third party."

equipe-project.smart-contracts.description.part1.desc2: "Smart Contracts are used to automate the terms of a contract recorded on a blockchain and allow it to be considered secure and transparent, because the blockchain is a decentralized and immutable data repository. This means that the parties involved in the contract have transparent access to the terms of the contract, as well as any changes to it. In addition, Smart Contracts are resistant to censorship and fraud, because their execution is based on crypto protocols that guarantee their security."

equipe-project.smart-contracts.description.part2.subtitle: "When we develop Smart Contracts, we follow these 4 key steps:"
equipe-project.smart-contracts.description.part2.subtitle.part1: "When we develop Smart Contracts, we follow these"

equipe-project.smart-contracts.description.part2.desc1.part1: "Definition of the terms of the contract"
equipe-project.smart-contracts.description.part2.desc1.part2: "The parties involved in the contract define the terms and conditions which will be fixed once published on the blockchain by the execution of the computer program specifically created for this. "
equipe-project.smart-contracts.description.part2.desc2.part1: "Publication of the contract"
equipe-project.smart-contracts.description.part2.desc2.part2: "The Smart Contract is published on a blockchain for execution. The publication of the contract is usually done via a contract deployment transaction."
equipe-project.smart-contracts.description.part2.desc3.part1: "Execution of the contract"
equipe-project.smart-contracts.description.part2.desc3.part2: "Once the Smart Contract is published, it can be executed automatically according to the programmed terms. The execution of the contract is generally triggered by a transaction carried out on the blockchain."
equipe-project.smart-contracts.description.part2.desc4.part1: "Finalization of the contract"

### advantages section
advantages.smart-contracts.title.part1: "Why undertake a project to create and develop"
advantages.smart-contracts.title.part2: "Smart Contracts"

advantages.smart-contracts.title.baseline1: "The Smart Contract is considered the technological future of digital transactions, for 3 main reasons."
advantages.smart-contracts.title.baseline2: "The first is that these smart contracts have become a reliable and authentic means of securing an agreement between several parties, in the private and professional fields. Thanks to Blockchain technology, the simple fact to establish a Smart Contract provides several guarantees such as access to unique and authentic information, which removes the risk of conflict.In addition, the data of the contract being recorded on the Blockchain, they remain tamper-proof, which reinforces the integrity of the Smart Contract and protects it from possible computer fraud. Finally, transactions are only carried out when all the conditions are met, which eliminates the threat of error or fraud."
advantages.smart-contracts.title.baseline3: "The second argument concerns the automation of payments on Smart Contracts, which offers many advantages over traditional contracts. On the one hand, this type of process reduces the risk of payment is triggered according to the conditions issued in the contract, without a legal deadline. Moreover, it is possible for smart contracts to carry out a total or partial payment execution, depending on the wishes of the stakeholders. Finally, some Smart Contracts offer the use of a legal construct in which the assets are handed over to an independent third party (called Escrow) who blocks payment until full verification of the terms of the contract. This also limits the risk of non-payment."
advantages.smart-contracts.title.baseline4: "Finally, the third advantage is related to the reduction in the costs of implementing the contract, from the elaboration to the realization of the project. A traditional contract is normally sealed between several parties by through an approved professional such as a lawyer or a notary, whose fees can reach expensive sums"
advantages.smart-contracts.title.baseline5: "In the context of Smarts Contracts, the costs incurred are lower, because the only professionals included in this process are the developers, whose remuneration is not comparable to that of the professionals mentioned above ."
advantages.smart-contracts.title.baseline6: "Furthermore, since the execution of these smart contracts is automated, there is no need to involve an intermediary during its application. Thanks to the transparency of the Blockchain, it is possible to verify compliance with the contract in real time, without having to purchase an additional service."


## D-Apps

### section3
section3.d-apps.baseline3: "Kodkodkod: know-how for decentralized applications"
section3.d-apps.baseline4: "The development of decentralized applications on Blockchain (DApps) represents a major challenge ahead for companies, with a new way of understanding their model using Blockchain technology. In addition to this deep understanding and meticulous understanding of the operation of the Blockchain, the specific skills of a developer are required to take charge of this type of project.They must be trained in specific tools and programming languages such as mastery of Solidity, to successfully create a decentralized application in complete security and in compliance with the standards established in this field.
Kodkodkod has the resources and solid skills to carry out each DApp creation project, in such a way as to provide its customers with considerable advantages for their business. Indeed, as indicated above, a DApp is an application as we know it in the everyday world, but whose hosting is carried out in a decentralized way on the Blockchain. Its operation being autonomous thanks to a series of Smart Contracts which each have their function and usefulness within the digital project, your Kodkodkod studio knows how to program smart contracts, create the associated tokens necessary for the proper functioning of any DApp."

### project-team
equipe-project.d-apps.sub-title.part2: "Your DApps"
equipe-project.d-apps.description.part1.subtitle: "What is a DApp?"
equipe-project.d-apps.description.part1.desc1: "In digital language, a DApp is a decentralized application, that is, an application that works independently, without the help of a server centralized, thanks to a system in which the digital flow is distributed between several interconnected networks. The majority of DApps operate on the Ethereum blockchain; their creation requires meticulous know-how on the part of the developers who manipulate these decentralized applications thanks to smart contracts, with the idea of managing the distribution of data as well as user interactions across the network, so developers use various digital programming languages to edit the code of DApps (including Solidity or Vyper for example). Note that besides the popularity of Ethereum, there are other Blockchains that support DApps like BSC, EOS or Cardano."
equipe-project.d-apps.description.part1.desc2: "DApps are often associated with the world of crypto because they too can be exploited to provide digital products and services. When creating a DApp, professionals must take care to protect users against any risk of cyberattack, making security a crucial element in the storage of data on the decentralized network.Decentralized applications (DApps) provide an infinite potential of services without having to use of centralized servers, which offers more freedom and privacy to Internet users, while reducing the financial costs of investors. DApps are considered to be the future of applications on the web of the 21st century."
